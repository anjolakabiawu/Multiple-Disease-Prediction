# 🌺 Multiple Disease Prediction System

This is a web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's Disease** based on user-provided medical details. The system uses pre-trained machine learning models to make real-time predictions.
